# AWS Panorama Object Detection with YOLOv5 Example

This is an end to end example that shows how to deploy a YOLOv5 machine learning model, pre-trained with MS COCO dataset using PyTorch, to a Panorama appliance.

## Files Included

- utils.py
- yolov5s_lambda.py
- yolov5s.ipynb
- test.png
- test-result.png

### Use Case

- Build a custom object detector using a pre-trained model using PyTorch
- First step towards training your own PyTorch trained object detection model with YOLOv5

### Setup

This sample includes a submodule pointing to [YOLOv5 repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5). Make sure to add `--recursive` when pulling the code from this repository.

### How to use the Notebook

The included Jupyter Notebook gives a guided tour of deploying a pre-trained YOLOv5 ML model. Follow the step by step instructions in the Notebook to deploy the provided model and Application code to the Panorama appliance. We recommend using SageMaker Notebook Instance to run the Notebook as it will have most of the dependencies pre-installed (including the AWS CLI tool). Select `conda_python3` kernel is using Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance.

If the Notebook is not executed on Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance then you'll have to install and configure AWS CLI tools (see the [Resources](#Resources) section for details) 

### Example Output

This is an example output from running the inference on a Panorama appliance

### How to use the Lambda Function

Notebook has all the code necessary to pack the included Lambda function into a zip file and deploy it. Alternatively, that zip file can be directly uploaded to the Lambda console to create a Lambda.
